## Summary
Cave Logger is a basic SQLite database interface written in Go, and it allows cavers to track the caves that they have been to, who with, and when.

## Install
You can install by the following set of instructions:

1. Clone or download the repo, and naviagte to the repo directory
2. Compile the binary with `make`
3. Assuming the binary has built correctly then you have two courses of action:
    - A. If you have no data to import from another media (or wish to manually insert your data) then simply run `./scripts/make-db.py` and this will create a correctly formatted sqlite database and a config file. This script will also check for a pre-existing config file so as not to overwrite one.
    - B. If you do wish to import existing records then I have a Python script under `./scripts/csv2sqlite.py` that you can modify to your purposes. Note this script will create the database for itself.
4. Finally run `make install`.
5. You will now (provided you have a GOPATH set up) be able to run the application by running `cave-logger` in your shell. This can be overridden with the `PREFIX` variable, i.e. `make PREFIX=/usr/local/bin`.
